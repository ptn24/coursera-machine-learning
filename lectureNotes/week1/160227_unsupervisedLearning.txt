Unsupervised learning.

In unsupervised learning, we are given data that have no labels.
We must derive structure from the data.

Examples of clustering:
  - Groups of stories on gnews.
  - Understanding genomics.
  - Market segmentation.

Another example of unsupervised learning is associative memory.

Example: Cocktail party problem.
The goal is to separate audio sources from a combined recording.
This is one-liner in Octave.
Used single value decomposition (SVD).

*It is good idea to prototype our ML algo in Octave and then migrate it to
C++ or the like later. This saves on time to prototype.*

Next time, we will learn about specific learning algos and how to implement
them.
