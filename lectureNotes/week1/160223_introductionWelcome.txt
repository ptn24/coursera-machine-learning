In this course, we learn about ML algos and then apply them to real-world
problems.

Examples of ML:
  - Database mining: Large databases arose due to growth of the internet.
  - Applications that we cannot engineer by hand.
  - Self-customizing applications: Customized recommendations.
  - Understanding human learning: Artificial intelligence.

Next time, we will define ML and other ML terminologies.
