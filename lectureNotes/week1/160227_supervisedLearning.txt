Example: Predicting housing prices.
Question: Do we want to draw a straight line, or a quadratic line, through the
data?

Supervised learning occurs when the "right answers" are given.
In the housing prices dataset, the actual prices at which the houses were sold
were given.

Supervised learning can be broken down into two types:
  - Regression: Predict continuous-valued output (e.g., price).
  - Classification: Predict discrete-valued output (e.g., given plot of age
    versus tumor size, we draw a line to separate the data).

Question: How can we deal with infinite number of features?
Answer: Support vector machine (SVM).
