My name is Peter Nguyen and I currently reside in Mountain View, CA. I
graduated from MIT with degrees in Computer Science and Molecular Biology, and
Biological Engineering. I am currently a software engineer at a biotechnology
startup. With machine learning, I aim to one day build intelligent systems to
facilitate medical research, expedite diagnostic and therapeutic development,
and deliver real-time personalized medicine.
